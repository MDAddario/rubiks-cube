# rubiks-cube
Rubik's cube framework and solver

This program generates a rubik's cube framework that is capable of maintaining a digital rubik's cube, can perform standard rubik's cube operations (scramble, reset, R, U...), can output a .bmp file with a visual decomposition of any given cube state, and provides a tree-search algorithm to solve the rubik's cube.
